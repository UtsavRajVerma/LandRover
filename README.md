For many people it is a machine that imitates a humanâ€”like the androids in Star Wars, Terminator and Star Trek: The Next Generation.
In present time almost all the people are familiar with robots. Robots play a very important role in human life. Robots are a machine which reduces the human efforts in heavy works in industries, building etc. and makes life easy. We are here with our next robot that is Mobile or DTMF Controlled Robot. DTMF controlled Robot runs over mobile DTMF technology that exists in Dial tone.
DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multiple Frequency. There are some frequencies that we use to create DTMF tone. In simple words by adding or mixing two or more frequencies generates DTMF tone.

* Connecting wires

## What is DTMF? 
DTMF is a Dual Tone Multiple Frequency decoder module which has a MT8870 DTMF decoder IC which decodes DTMF tone signal to digital signal that are acceptable for arduino digitally. Here an aux wire is needed for connecting DTMF module to phone.
