## Programming Code
* In program first of all we have defined output pins for motors and Input pins for DTMF decoder output as in INPUT for Arduino.

* And then in setup set motor pin as OUTPUT and DTMF decoder output pins as INPUT.

* After that we read DTMF decoder output and then compare with defined values by using “if” statement and perform relative operation.
