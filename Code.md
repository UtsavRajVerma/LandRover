In program first of all we have defined output pins for motors and Input pins for DTMF decoder output as in INPUT for Arduino.

And then in setup set motor pin as OUTPUT and DTMF decoder output pins as INPUT.

After that we read DTMF decoder output and then compare with defined values by using “if” statement and perform relative operation.
